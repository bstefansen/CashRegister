# Cash Register
A java-script program that simulates a cash register returning change.

There are three inputs for the checkCashRegister() function:
<br><br>
price = The price of an item
<br>
cash = The amount of cash the customer is using to pay
<br>
cid = The amount of cash in the drawer. This is input as an array

Ex.
console.log(checkCashRegister(19.5, 20, [["PENNY", 0.5], ["NICKEL", 0], ["DIME", 0], ["QUARTER", 0], ["ONE", 0], ["FIVE", 0], ["TEN", 0], ["TWENTY", 0], ["ONE HUNDRED", 0]]));
